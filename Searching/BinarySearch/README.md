# Binary Search
A simple C# solution to demonstrate the process of a binary search.

## Notes
This solution can be optimized further by breaking down the search function to examine two indexes (left and right) of the array at a time.
The solution has been coded in this way for clarity purposes solely to demonstrate the steps involved in a binary search.
