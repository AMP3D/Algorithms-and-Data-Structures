# MergeSort
A simple C# solution to demonstrate the process of a merge sort.

## Notes
This solution can be optimized further to work directly off of the original unsorted array as opposed to copying the sorted array into a new array variable.
The solution has been coded in this way for clarity purposes solely to demonstrate the steps involved in a merge sort.
